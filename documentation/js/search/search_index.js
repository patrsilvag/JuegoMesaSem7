exploración y compra de juegos de mesa familiares.\nEl proyecto fue generado con Angular CLI 20.3.9. \nTabla de Contenidos\n\nDescripción General\nCaracterísticas Principales\nTecnologías Utilizadas\nRequisitos Previos\nInstalación y Puesta en Marcha\nEstructura del Proyecto\nPruebas\n\n\nDescripción General\nJuegos de Mesa – Cuatro Esquinas es una SPA (Single Page Application) que simula una tienda de juegos de mesa.Permite a los usuarios:\n\nExplorar categorías de juegos.\nVer el detalle de los productos.\nAgregar ítems a un carrito de compras.\nRegistrarse, iniciar sesión y gestionar su perfil.\n(Opcional) Acceder a un panel de administración protegido por rol.\n\nLa aplicación está diseñada con una arquitectura modular, separando responsabilidades entre componentes, servicios, guards y módulos para favorecer la escalabilidad y el mantenimiento.\nCaracterísticas Principales\n\nCatálogo de juegos de mesa\n\nListado de categorías.\nVistas de productos por categoría.\nDetalle básico de cada juego (imagen, título, precio, etc.).\n\n\nCarrito de compras\n\nAgregar / eliminar productos.\nActualizar cantidades.\nCálculo automático de subtotal, costo de envío y total.\nSoporte para cupones de descuento (lógica encapsulada en servicios).\n\n\nAutenticación de usuarios\n\nRegistro de nuevos usuarios con formularios reactivos.\nInicio de sesión con validaciones de credenciales.\nGestión de sesión a nivel de frontend.\n\n\nPerfil de usuario\n\nVisualización de datos básicos del usuario autenticado.\nActualización de información y cambio de contraseña.\n\n\nPanel de administración (si aplica)\n\nAcceso protegido mediante guards por rol.\nListado de usuarios y cambio de estado (activo/inactivo).\n\n\nDiseño responsivo\n\nMaquetación con Bootstrap y estilos personalizados en SCSS.\nAdaptación automática a distintos tamaños de pantalla (desktop, tablet, móvil).\n\n\n\n\nTecnologías Utilizadas\n\nFramework Frontend: Angular  \nLenguaje: TypeScript  \nCLI: Angular CLI 20.3.9 :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  \nEstilos y UI:\nBootstrap (sistema de grillas, componentes básicos).\nSCSS para estilos personalizados.\n\n\nPruebas:\nKarma + Jasmine para pruebas unitarias. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}\n\n\n\n\nRequisitos Previos\nAntes de clonar y ejecutar el proyecto, asegúrate de tener instalado:\n\nNode.js (versión LTS recomendada).\nnpm (incluido con Node.js).\nAngular CLI:\n\nExample :npm install -g @angular/cli\n\n\n\n## Estructura del Proyecto\n\nLa aplicación sigue una arquitectura modular organizada principalmente en **páginas** (vistas) y **componentes compartidos**. A continuación se detalla el contenido de los directorios principales dentro de `src/app`:\n\n- **`core/`**: Contiene la lógica esencial y de única instancia, como los **guards** para proteger rutas (admin, usuarios).\n- **`pages/`**: Aquí se encuentran los componentes que actúan como \"vistas\" o páginas completas de la aplicación:\n  - **`admin/`**: Panel de gestión.\n  - **`home/`**: Página de inicio (Landing page).\n  - **`carrito/`**: Vista del resumen de compra.\n  - **`login/`, `registro/`, `recuperar/`**: Vistas de autenticación.\n  - **`categoria/`**: Exploración de productos.\n- **`shared/`**: Componentes visuales reutilizables que aparecen en múltiples partes de la app, como el  **navbar**, el **footer** y las notificaciones tipo **toast**.\n- **`assets/`**: Recursos estáticos, incluyendo las imágenes de las categorías de juegos.\n\n### Árbol de Directorios\n\n```text\n+---app\n|   +---core\n|   |   \\---guards\n|   +---pages\n|   |   +---admin\n|   |   +---carrito\n|   |   +---categoria\n|   |   +---home\n|   |   +---login\n|   |   +---perfil\n|   |   +---recuperar\n|   |   \\---registro\n|   +---shared\n|   |   +---footer\n|   |   +---navbar\n|   |   \\---toast\n|   \\---styles\n\\---assets\n    \\---img\n        \\---categorias\n\n## Pruebas\n\nLas pruebas unitarias se implementan en los archivos con extensión `*.spec.ts` y cubren principalmente:\n\n- **Creación básica** de componentes y servicios.\n- **Validaciones simples** de formularios reactivos.\n- **Comportamiento esperado** de métodos de lógica de negocio.\n\nPara ejecutar las pruebas, utiliza el comando:\n\n```bash\nng test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No
