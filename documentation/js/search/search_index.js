Bootstrap y estilos personalizados en SCSS.\nAdaptación automática a distintos tamaños de pantalla (desktop, tablet, móvil).\n\n\n\n\nTecnologías Utilizadas\n\nFramework Frontend: Angular  \nLenguaje: TypeScript  \nCLI: Angular CLI 20.3.9 :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  \nEstilos y UI:\nBootstrap (sistema de grillas, componentes básicos).\nSCSS para estilos personalizados.\n\n\nPruebas:\nKarma + Jasmine para pruebas unitarias. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}\n\n\n\n\nRequisitos Previos\nAntes de clonar y ejecutar el proyecto, asegúrate de tener instalado:\n\nNode.js (versión LTS recomendada).\nnpm (incluido con Node.js).\nAngular CLI:\n\nExample :npm install -g @angular/cli\n\n\n\n## Estructura del Proyecto\n\nLa aplicación sigue una arquitectura modular organizada principalmente en **páginas** (vistas) y **componentes compartidos**. A continuación se detalla el contenido de los directorios principales dentro de `src/app`:\n\n- **`core/`**: Contiene la lógica esencial y de única instancia, como los **guards** para proteger rutas (admin, usuarios).\n- **`pages/`**: Aquí se encuentran los componentes que actúan como \"vistas\" o páginas completas de la aplicación:\n  - **`admin/`**: Panel de gestión.\n  - **`home/`**: Página de inicio (Landing page).\n  - **`carrito/`**: Vista del resumen de compra.\n  - **`login/`, `registro/`, `recuperar/`**: Vistas de autenticación.\n  - **`categoria/`**: Exploración de productos.\n- **`shared/`**: Componentes visuales reutilizables que aparecen en múltiples partes de la app, como el  **navbar**, el **footer** y las notificaciones tipo **toast**.\n- **`assets/`**: Recursos estáticos, incluyendo las imágenes de las categorías de juegos.\n\n### Árbol de Directorios\n\n```text\n+---app\n|   +---core\n|   |   \\---guards\n|   +---pages\n|   |   +---admin\n|   |

  \\---toast\n|   \\---styles\n\\---assets\n    \\---img\n        \\---categorias\n\n## Pruebas\n\nLas pruebas unitarias se implementan en los archivos con extensión `*.spec.ts` y cubren principalmente:\n\n- **Creación básica** de componentes y servicios.\n- **Validaciones simples** de formularios reactivos.\n- **Comportamiento esperado** de métodos de lógica de negocio.\n\nPara ejecutar las pruebas, utiliza el comando:\n\n```bash\nng test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No
